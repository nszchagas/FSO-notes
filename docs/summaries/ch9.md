## Overview

Disk drives are the major secondary storage I/O devices on most computers. Most secondary storage devices are either magnetic tapes or hard disks, but solid-state disks are becoming more popular.

## Disk Structure

Modern disk drives are structured as large one-dimensional arrays of logical disk blocks, usually having 512 bytes of size.

## Disk Attachment

Disks may be attached to a computer system in one of two ways:

- Through the local I/O ports on the host computer
- Through a network connection

## Disk Scheduling

## Swap-Space Management

## RAID Structure

## Stable-Storage Implementation
